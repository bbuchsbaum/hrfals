Description: Implements the Confound-Adjusted Alternating Least Squares (CF-ALS) method for estimating hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) from fMRI data. The package provides fast, accurate, and robust alternatives for data-driven HRF estimation that work with any HRF basis from the fmridesign and fmrihrf packages.
