\title{Create CFALS design from events and data}
\usage{
hrfals_design(
  events,
  TR,
  basis,
  fmri_data_obj,
  confound_obj = NULL,
  baseline_model = NULL,
  formula = onset ~ hrf(condition),
  block = if ("block" \%in\% names(events)) ~block else NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{Data frame with at least an `onset` column and any factors used
in the event model. If a `block` column is not present a single block is
assumed.}

\item{TR}{Numeric. Repetition time in seconds.}

\item{basis}{An `HRF` basis object.}

\item{fmri_data_obj}{BOLD data matrix (time points \eqn{\times} voxels) or
`fmridesign::fmri_dataset`.}

\item{confound_obj}{Optional confound matrix with the same number of rows as
`fmri_data_obj`.}

\item{baseline_model}{Optional baseline model whose design matrix is
projected alongside `confound_obj`.}

\item{formula}{Model formula passed to [fmridesign::event_model()]. The default
expects a column named `condition` in `events`.}

\item{block}{Formula specifying the block column. Defaults to `~ block` if a
`block` column is present.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to [fmridesign::event_model()].}
}
\value{
A list as returned by [create_cfals_design()].
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper that first constructs an `fmridesign::event_model` from a
data.frame of events and then calls [create_cfals_design()] to generate
the matrices required for CFALS estimation.
