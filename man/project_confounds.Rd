\title{Project design and data matrices to the null space of confounds}
\usage{
project_confounds(Y, X_list, confounds = NULL, lapack_qr = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix of BOLD data (time points \eqn{\times}
voxels).}

\item{X_list}{A list of design matrices with the same number of
rows as `Y`.}

\item{confounds}{Optional confound matrix with matching rows.}

\item{lapack_qr}{Logical; passed to `qr()` as the `LAPACK`
argument.}
}
\value{
A list with projected `X_list` and `Y` matrices.
}
\description{
Projects both the data matrix `Y` and each design matrix in
`X_list` using QR decomposition of the confound matrix.  The
projection can optionally use LAPACK's QR implementation for
improved numerical stability.
