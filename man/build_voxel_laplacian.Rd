\title{Build a Voxel Graph Laplacian}
\usage{
build_voxel_laplacian(volume, connectivity = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{3D array or `neuroim2::NeuroVol` mask defining the
spatial domain.}

\item{connectivity}{Neighbourhood definition. Either 6, 18 or 26.}
}
\value{
List with sparse Laplacian matrix `L` (`dgCMatrix`) and the
  numeric degree vector `degree`.
}
\description{
Constructs an unnormalised graph Laplacian matrix for the voxels
contained in a 3D mask volume. The function accepts objects that can
be coerced to an array (e.g. a `neuroim2::NeuroVol`). Non-zero
elements of the volume are treated as included voxels.
