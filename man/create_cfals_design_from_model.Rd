\title{Create CFALS Design from fmrireg Model}
\usage{
create_cfals_design_from_model(...)
}
\description{
This helper previously attempted to build CFALS design matrices directly
from an `fmri_model` object. The approach proved brittle and has been
removed.  Users should instead call [create_cfals_design()] with an
`event_model` and HRF basis.
